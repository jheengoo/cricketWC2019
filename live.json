James Cameron-Dow to Hashmatullah Shahidi. Stock ball back of a length, outside off stump on the back foot pulling, well timed in the air under control past deep square leg for 4 runs. That's the moment, joy for Afghanistan! Amazing scenes in Dehradun. \n\n Afghanistan have created history by registering their first Test victory, beating Ireland by seven wickets in Dehradun. It looked like it could be a tricky target but Rahmat Shah and Ihsanullah calmed the nerves with a superb 139 run partnership. Rahmat was probably the difference between the two sides over the course of the match, his patient first innings 98 set things up as the hosts built a sizeable lead. Rashid Khan was another standout performer, bowling beautifully on the third day to claim a maiden Test five wicket haul. Ireland will reflect that they didn't score enough first innings runs, despite a swashbuckling fifty from number eleven Tim Murtagh. After winning the toss, 172 was a way below par total on a placid pitch and left them always fighting to stay in the game. Nonetheless, they did themselves proud and showed admirable improvement in the second dig. It's all about Afghanistan now though, back home they will be celebrating from Kabul to Kandahar after an amazing journey to get Test status. In Dehradun the party will go long into the night.","isFallOfWicket":false,"batsmanId":5555,"batsmanName":"Hashmatullah Shahidi","bowlerId":12491,"bowlerName":"James Cameron-Dow","runs":"4","battingTeamScore":149,"offStrikeBatsmanId":7084,"wickets":3}],"id":288,"result":"4"},{"ballNumber":4,"comments":[{"id":1,"ballType":"LegitOffBat","dateTime":"2019-03-18T06:30:41Z","text":"OUT!

Caught. Mitchell Marsh to Tim Paine. Length ball, driving, False Shot to cover, by Short. Western Australia have won by 51 runs after a gallant fight from Tasmania. The visitors got off to a great start to Day 4 with the wickets of Jordan Silk and Alex Doolan in the first two overs of the day, however a brilliant middle order partnership between Matthew Wade and Ben McDermott gave Tasmania a slight glimpse of victory. Matthew Wade continued his brilliant form with a score of 134, however, when he and McDermott fell within a few overs, the home sides chances dropped dramatically. Joel Paris and Mitchell Marsh were the pick of the bowlers for the visitors, both finishing with 3 wickets, while Sam Whiteman was named Player of the Match for his consistent batting performance throughout the match.
