New South Wales have booked a spot into the Shield final thanks to some brillant fast bowling from Sean Abbott and Trent Copeland. After a gutsy declaration, the visitors required 10 wickets to book a final spot and they achieved that in the first session. Sean Abbott claimed figures of 7-45, while he was well supported by Trent Copeland who had figures of 2-31. Matthew Wade again played a great innings compiling a score of 65, however, he had little help in trying to chase the total of 269. Sean Abbott was named man of the match thanks to his first innings with the bat and a brillant bowling display today. Thanks from Blundstone Arena.

Full toss, to leg on the front foot flick, to deep mid wicket for 2 runs, shy attempt by Malik. Australia seal the victory. That is the second highest run chase at this ground. A perfect display with the bat for the visitors. Earlier Haris Sohail struck his maiden ODI century, but that was then eclipsed by Aaron Finch getting a hundred of his own. Shaun Marsh finished with an impressive 91 not out, as Pakistan rarely threatened with the ball in hand. A convincing win sees Australia go 1-0 up in the five match series, with the next one on Sunday. Join us then to see if they can double that lead, or if Pakistan can level things up.","isFallOfWicket":false,"batsmanId":3824,"batsmanName":"Shaun Marsh","batsmanImageURL":"https:\/\/www.cricket.com.au\/-\/media\/Players\/Men\/International\/Australia\/ODI\/Shaun-Marsh-ODI1819.ashx","bowlerId":4294,"bowlerName":"Mohammad Amir","bowlerImageURL":"https:\/\/www.cricket.com.au\/-\/media\/Players\/Men\/International\/Pakistan\/Mohammad-Amir-CT17.ashx","runs":"2","battingTeamScore":281,"offStrikeBatsmanId":5940,"wickets":2}],"id":300,"result":"2"},{"ballNumber":5,"comments":[{"id":1,"ballType":"LegitOffBat","dateTime":"2019-03-22T18:38:55Z","text":"FOUR!
