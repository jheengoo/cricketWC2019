Googly length ball, outside off stump on the front foot pushing, to short mid wicket for 1 run, fielded by Afghan.  A wonderful partnership between Balbirnie and McCollum has given Ireland a big boost on St Patrick's Day in Dehradun. Afghanistan got a slice of luck early this morning when Stirling was adjudged LBW off an inside edge, but after that they lost their patience with the ball. The skipper Asghar Afghan is having an animated talk with his team before they head off for lunch, that tells you that he isn't impressed at all with what he has seen. The tourists now trail by just 18 runs with this Test match shaping up to be a thriller.
