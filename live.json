Left-Arm Leg Spin length ball, off stump on the front foot working, to square leg for 1 run, fielded by Perera.  South Africa have completed a commanding victory in the First ODI against Sri Lanka in Johannesburg, cruising to their target just two wickets down and with lots of overs left in the bank. The total of 231 all out made by the tourists never looked like it was going to be enough and a serene partnership of 136 between Quinton de Kock and Faf du Plessis made sure of that fact. The South African skipper went on to make an unbeaten 112, his eleventh ODI century, as The Wanderers cheered him on in the afternoon sunshine. Sri Lanka made the mistake of dropping him early on and that sucked the energy from their performance, with the bowlers and fielders all looking fairly flat. Earlier in the day, Imran Tahir was excellent with the ball on a dry surface - his spell of 26-3 was as parsimonious as it was threatening. Sri Lanka contributed to their own downfall with the bat with soft dismissals costing them dearly, although Oshada Fernando played some eye-catching strokes on debut before Kusal Mendis' half century. They will need to improve on that in the Second ODI on Wednesday which takes place at Centurion.

Chasing 166 for victory, NSW were demolished by some hostile bowling from Pattinson who finished with 5-25. Siddle bowled his usual probing line and length and with some assistance from the overhead conditions, took the important wicket of Hughes to get the ball rolling for the visitors. A spirited last wicket partnership of 48 between Nevill and O'Keefe ensured NSW avoided their lowest ever Shield score against Victoria but it was the visitors day who wrapped up a highly entertaining and bowler-friendly match midway through the second session. \nThis victory has all but assured Victoria of hosting the final, while NSW will still need to win their last match against Tasmania to ensure they will be their opponents ","isFallOfWicket":true,"batsmanId":4827,"batsmanName":"Steve O'Keefe","batsmanImageURL":"https:\/\/www.cricket.com.au\/-\/media\/Players\/Men\/Domestic\/NSW%20Blues\/SteveOKeefeJLT18.ashx","bowlerId":5979,"bowlerName":"Scott Boland","bowlerImageURL":"https:\/\/www.cricket.com.au\/-\/media\/Players\/Men\/Domestic\/VIC%20Bushrangers\/Scott-Boland-JLT18.ashx","runs":"0","battingTeamScore":102,"offStrikeBatsmanId":5316,"wickets":10,"wicketSummary":{"batsmanImage":"https:\/\/www.cricket.com.au\/-\/media\/Players\/Men\/Domestic\/NSW%20Blues\/SteveOKeefeJLT18.ashx","batsmanName":"Steve O'Keefe","dismissalMethod":"c: Dean b: Boland","batsmanRuns":"25","ballsFaced":"48","batsman4sinInnings":"2","batsman6sinInnings":"0","strikeRate":"52.08"}}],"id":235,"result":"0"},{"ballNumber":4,"comments":[{"id":1,"ballType":"LegitOffBat","dateTime":"2019-03-14T03:18:03Z","text":"Scott Boland to Steve O'Keefe.
