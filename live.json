One shot too many from Murtagh and he's got to go. It was short and he couldn't resist a big swipe, it ballooned up for a simple catch in the deep. \n\n Afghanistan will require 147 runs for their first ever Test victory. It could have been much better for the hosts but another eleventh wicket partnership frustrated them after Rashid Khan had picked up a five wicket haul. Ireland battled hard with the bat, now they will have to be at their absolute best with the ball to put pressure on the hosts.
