South Africa have completed a comfortable victory over Sri Lanka, despite intervention by the rain, to secure a 3-0 series whitewash in the T20Is. That comes on the back of a 5-0 ODI series, so the tourists will leave these shores disappointed with their performance in white ball cricket. Nonetheless, their victory in the Test series will live long in the memory and will have brought plenty of joy to the Sri Lankan fans. The Proteas were thoroughly professional this afternoon, with Reeza Hendricks (66) and Dwaine Pretorius (77*) combining in brutal fashion with the bat and Andile Phehlukwayo (24-4) displaying impressive variations with the ball.  Once again Isuru Udana offered swashbuckling resistance, but the task was always too big for him. One major difference between the two sides was the fielding, with the visitors making several costly sloppy mistakes. That brings this tour to an end, thanks for joining us.
