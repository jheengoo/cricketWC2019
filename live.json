Caught. Scott Boland to Steve O'Keefe. Length ball, working, False Shot to mid wicket, by Dean.

Chasing 166 for victory, NSW were demolished by some hostile bowling from Pattinson who finished with 5-25. Siddle bowled his usual probing line and length and with some assistance from the overhead conditions, took the important wicket of Hughes to get the ball rolling for the visitors. A spirited last wicket partnership of 48 between Nevill and O'Keefe ensured NSW avoided their lowest ever Shield score against Victoria but it was the visitors day who wrapped up a highly entertaining and bowler-friendly match midway through the second session. \nThis victory has all but assured Victoria of hosting the final, while NSW will still need to win their last match against Tasmania to ensure they will be their opponents ","isFallOfWicket":true,"batsmanId":4827,"batsmanName":"Steve O'Keefe","batsmanImageURL":"https:\/\/www.cricket.com.au\/-\/media\/Players\/Men\/Domestic\/NSW%20Blues\/SteveOKeefeJLT18.ashx","bowlerId":5979,"bowlerName":"Scott Boland","bowlerImageURL":"https:\/\/www.cricket.com.au\/-\/media\/Players\/Men\/Domestic\/VIC%20Bushrangers\/Scott-Boland-JLT18.ashx","runs":"0","battingTeamScore":102,"offStrikeBatsmanId":5316,"wickets":10,"wicketSummary":{"batsmanImage":"https:\/\/www.cricket.com.au\/-\/media\/Players\/Men\/Domestic\/NSW%20Blues\/SteveOKeefeJLT18.ashx","batsmanName":"Steve O'Keefe","dismissalMethod":"c: Dean b: Boland","batsmanRuns":"25","ballsFaced":"48","batsman4sinInnings":"2","batsman6sinInnings":"0","strikeRate":"52.08"}}],"id":235,"result":"0wk"},{"ballNumber":4,"comments":[{"id":1,"ballType":"LegitOffBat","dateTime":"2019-03-14T03:18:03Z","text":"Scott Boland to Steve O'Keefe.
