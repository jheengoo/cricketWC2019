In a way it's a shame that there's not one more over in this game. What he did prove is just how much you can catch up at the end of a T20 innings. Sri Lanka lost this game early in the second innings when their top order became a procession of batsmen back and forth from the pavilion. For South Africa both Hendricks and van der Dussen impressed with bat in hand. There will be a decision for South African selectors to make there when it comes to the World Cup.
